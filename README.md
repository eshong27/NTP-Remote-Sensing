## About this repo
**Introduction:** This repo contains a set of remote sensing tools leveraging ML / feature engineering and some sampled data to test it on from the `Lac Flocon` event on September 5th, 2018. Raw data files were much too large to store with version control on Git. Most aerial imagery from previous events has either been copied to a `data` subfolder under root locally or uploaded to a GCS VM.
